Task: Analyze the provided Solidity mutant and hypothesize a test case that should be able to detect it (i.e., "kill" it) just like a senior test automation engineer would.

Instructions:
    Consider the original smart contract {contract_id}:
        Contract Code: {contract_code}

    Consider the following mutant of {contract_id}:
        {mutant_details}
        Mutant Diff: {mutant_diff}

    1 - Formulate a hypothesis for a test case that should pass on the original smart contract, but kill (e.g.: fail on) the mutant.        
        You must respond with a single, synthetic description of the test in natural language, without including code examples.
        These are some example hypotheses for reference:
          - Example 1: "Hypothesis": "The mutant removes the onlyOwner modifier from the function. Therefore, a test case that calls the mutated function from an unauthorized address and expects a revert should kill the mutant."
          - Example 2: "Hypothesis": "The mutant removes an event emission. Therefore, a test case that checks if the event is emitted should kill the mutant."
    
    First think step-by-step, look at the differences between the original and the mutant, and then hypotesize a test case that should be able to detect the mutant.
