Objective: Fix the provided HardHat test file so that it compiles and can be executed successfully on the smart contract.

Instructions:
    Consider the following test file: {test_code}
    
    This test file is expected to pass on the following smart contract: {contract_code}
    
    However, the test file either fails or does not compile due to the following reason: {error_log} 

    You must fix any syntactic/semantic issue that prevents the test file from running and passing.

Output Format:
    Provide your fixed test file code as an executable TypeScript file enclosed within the \'```typescript\' and \'```\' markers, without any additional text.
