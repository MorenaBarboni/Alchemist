Task: Derive a test case to kill the live Solidity mutant just like a senior test automation engineer would.

Instructions:
    1 - Generate the Test: Based on the previous hypothesis, you must generate a test case to kill mutant {mutant_id} of {contract_id}.
        Requirements:       
        - You must generate a single HardHat test case in Typescript that directly tests the mutant.
        - The test case should be included in a test file with all all necessary imports, setups, and hooks to ensure it can run as-is. 
        - You must use the provided Reference Test Suite Setup as a reference for generating the new test case.
        - Do not use mocks, placeholders or undefined variables, and do not call functions or other elements that do not exist in the smart contract under test {contract_id}.
        - Pay attention to the syntax of the generated code, avoiding Solidity syntax errors.
    First think step-by-step, look at the differences between the original and the mutant, consider the hypothesis, and then generate a test case that should be able to detect the mutant.

Reference Test Suite Setup for {contract_id}:
        Test Suite Setup: {initial_test_setup}

Output Format:
    Provide your experiment code within the \'```typescript\' and \'```\' markers, without any additional text.
