Task: Hypothesize a new test case that should be able to detect the solidity mutant (i.e., "kill" it).

Instructions: The previous hypothesis was rejected. Following the previously described methodology, you must:
    1 - Formulate a new hypothesis for a test case that should pass on the original smart contract, but kill (e.g.: fail on) the mutant.        
        You must respond with a single, synthetic description of the test in natural language, without including code examples.
